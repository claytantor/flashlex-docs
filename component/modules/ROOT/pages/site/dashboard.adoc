The user dashboard is the starting point for you as a FlashLex user to know all the important things about your FlashLex account.

- Your active subscription.
- A gauge showing how many things you have and how many you are allowed.
- A gauge showing how many messages have been sent from your thing (egress) and how many are allowed.

The dashboard gauges are intended to give you a simple visual representation of your subscription policy, which is how FlashLex determines what you are allowed to provision based on your subscription. 

=== The Thing Gauge
