== Overview
FlashLex Things are actually any device capabile of running the FlashLex Distribution and SDK. Currently that means any device that can effectively run Python applications in an automated way. 

Commonly this is a small single board computer such as a Raspberry PI but really it can be any python based computer with enough resources to run teh FlashLex Python distribution. 

There are a few expectations we about your thing that would enable your ability to effectively install and run the distribution.

1. Your thing has enough memory and compute scale to run the FlashLex distribution.
1. Your thing is connected to the internet.
1. You can SSH into your thing to install the distribution.

This guide will cover a few concepts essential to standing up your FlashLex IOT fleet:

- Provisioning A New Thing
- Downloading The Thing Distribution
- Bootstrapping 
- Sending a Test Message (Ingress)
- Collecting A Message From Your Thing (Egress)

== Provisioning A Thing
All things are provisioned from the "Things" Page. It is one of the top line menubar items as peer level to "Dashboard", "Access Token", and "User Settings".

Start by going to the "Things" page and clicking the button that says "Create Thing"

image::things-createform.png[Thing create form,400,800]

Give your thing a name and choose "Submit".

Once you do this the FlashLex application will orchestrate provisioning the cloud infrastructure for your thing. This includes building out your things topics, establishing the security rules, provisioning certificates and more. 

image::mything-created.png[Thing Created,700,50]

At this point you have the cloud infrastructure created, but no messages have been sent to your thing (ingress) or have been recieved from your thing (egress) so it is impossible to verify that the thing is actually up and running. Next step is to download and install the SDK on the thing and bootstrap it so you know it works.


== About The SDK Distribution
Your thing really is just software that allows a Python3 enabled device to run securely. Its job is to make it possible for almost any Python3 enabled computer to become a FlashLex Thing that can be easily integrated with your custom Python Thing application. When you download the distribution it has everything in it you need to integrate your custom thing application with FlashLex. 

image::thing-distribution.png[Thing Distribution,800,400]


**What is in The FlashLex SDK Distribution?**
The FlashLex SDK Distribution is a zip bundle file intended to be download and installed on the thing that you would like to integrate your custom application.

-  *FlashLex Bootstrap* - FlashLex Bootstrap is a stand alone python application that will allow you to verify that your thing is connected to the internet and works with FlashLex.
- *The FlashLex Service* - The FlashLex Service is a systemd service that can be installed to actively monitor the ingress topic for your thing and recieve messages over the MQTT topic.
- *The FlashLex SDK* - The FlashLex SDK is both what the FlashLex service uses and what your custom application will use to manage messages.
- *The FlashLex Message Database* - This is an local message database used to store and manage messages by the SDK.

The link:https://github.com/claytantor/flashlex-iot-python[flashlex-iot-python] distribution is an open source project on link:https://github.com[github.com] where the SDK is actively managed by the FlashLex Community. 

Its easy to collaborate and share you experiences and help others. Just join the link:https://gitter.im/flashlex-iot-python/community[FlashLex Python3 Thing SDK Gittr Channel]

== Downloading Your Thing's SDK Distribution
You will need to download and install your thing's sdk distribution. Each thing has a simple zip bundle created for it packed full of everything needed for that thing to send and recieve messages through FlashLex. 

To get that distribution go to the the specific thing's page on FlashLex and click the "Thing SDK" nav link on the thing navbar.

image::thing-distro-download.png[Thing Distribution Download,800,400]

There are two ways to download and install your thing's distribution:

- In Browser Download - Download the distribution from FlashLex in your browser and then copy the file to your thing. The zip file will be writtento your browser ~/Downloads directory.
- Use cURL on the Thing - Use a cUrl command to download the distribution using your API access token. SSH into your thing and run the cURL provided in the model window to download the thing distribution.

== Installing the Distribution

=== Installing the Distribution For Stand Alone
You will want to install your virtualenv for the flashlex dist as the first step. From the where you downloaded the zip distribution:

[source,bash]
----
unzip dist.zip
cd flashlex-iot-python/
python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
----

=== Installing the Distribution For You Thing Application
You will want to install the FlashLex API for use by your custom application. Usually this is done by installing FlashLex using `setup.py` after you have activated your project's virtual environment.

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/projects/flashlex-iot-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo python setup.py install
----


== Bootstrapping Your Thing
To insure that your thing is configured and working a bootstrap script is included to setup your thing distribution. 

The arguments for bootstrap are intended to tell the application where to find the database file, the certs and the configuration file for the application. Basically if the bootstrap runs you can be pretty confident that your thing will work with FlashLex.

- The FlashLex Configuration File - Contains all the application configurations and secrets.
- Keys Directory - Where to find the keys that allow your thing to securely communicate.
- Data Directory - Where the message database is stored that the SDK reads and writes to.

.bootstrap.py
[source,python]
----
parser.add_argument("-c", "--config", action="store", 
    required=True, dest="config", help="the YAML configuration file")
parser.add_argument("-d", "--data", action="store", 
    required=False, dest="data", default="{0}/data".format(dir_path), 
    help="the directory path for thing message data storage")
parser.add_argument("-k", "--keys", action="store", 
    required=False, dest="keys", default="{0}".format(parent_dir), 
    help="the directory path for keys")
----

You will want to make sure that you have your virtual environment activated with the command `source /venv/bin/activate` prior to running.

From the `flashlex-iot-python` distribution directory:

[source,bash]
----
python -u bootstrap.py -c $(pwd)/../config.yml -d $(pwd)/data -k $(pwd)/../.
----

and the bootstrap program should attempt to both send messages to flashlex (egress) and recieve messages (ingress)

[source,bash]

------------------------------------------------------------

Once the bootstrap has been run you should be able to see that 
the status of the thing has been verified.

== The FlashLex Configuration File
The FlashLex Configuration File is the primary configuration for the FlashLex service and SDK to know how to instrument, secure and route messages for your thing. When your distribution is created a boilerplate configuration file is also automatically created for your thing with the basic information required to run teh bootstrap.

NOTE: It is completely ok to modify or edit the config but remain mindful that the FlashLex service will also need to use a working config and that you may have to restart the service when changes are made.

== Running FlashLex IOT on the Command Line
Now that you have bootstrapped your device you will want to test that your thing can recieve messages. You will want to make sure that you have your virtual environment activated with the command `source /venv/bin/activate` prior to running. From the `flashlex-iot-python` distribution directory start by running the flashlex app from the command line:

[source,bash]
----------------
(venv) $ python -u app.py -c $(pwd)/../config.yml -d $(pwd)/data -k $(pwd)/../.

starting flashelex app.

----------------

== Sending a Test Message (Ingress)
Once the subscribe has started your thing is listening, its then possible to test that your thing is receiving messages from the FlashLex web console. Just go to the "Send Message Tab" and submit a message for your thing to recieve.

image::thing-page-send.png[Sending a test message,800,400]

If you have the `app.py` running on your thing you should see the message you created on the FlashLex web console be recieved (ingress) and displayed.

[source,bash]
----------------
Received a new message on client:ecd13b11-mything type:persistent:
{"message":{"message":"this is a test message YO!"}}
from topic:
ingress/ecd13b11-mything

----------------

== Running FlashLex IOT as systemctl Service
You will probably want to run both your application as well as the flashlex app as a `systemctl` service. That's because if your thing reboots or power is shortly discontinued and the system starts back up you will want an orderly orchestration of the services so they can start recieving or sending messages to flashlex. We have included a sample service defintion for flashlex that you will want to edit for your own installation.

Youc an find helpful tutorials on the internet on making services for your thing. Here is one that is pretty good:

link:https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units[How To Use systemctl to manage systemd services]

Start by making the service file that will be installed. This is done by running the `makeservice.py` script which uses the current directory to render the template correctly.

From the `flashlex-iot-python` distribution directory:

[source,bash]
----------------
python makeservice.py -t $(pwd)/flashlex.service.mustache -d $(pwd)>flashlex.service
----------------

Now that you have generated the `flashlex.service` file you can install it:

[source,bash]
----------------
sudo cp flashlex.service /lib/systemd/system/flashlex.service
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/flashlex.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable flashlex.service
sudo systemctl start flashlex.service
----------------

The `flashlex.service systemctl` should be running, you can check the status:

[source,bash]
----------------
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo systemctl status flashlex.service
● flashlex.service - flashlex
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/flashlex.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sat 2019-07-20 03:00:01 PDT; 18h ago

   CGroup: /system.slice/flashlex.service
           └─14574 /home/pi/projects/flashlex-iot-python/venv/bin/python -u /home/pi/projects/flashlex-iot-python/app.py --config /home/pi/projects/flashlex-iot-
----------------

== Collecting Messages (Egress)
Collecting messages is when you want to send messages out from the thing, this could be information that has been collected from the thing that you would like to use for 
you application.

=== Sending a message from your thing
Your thing uses its certificate to send messages out to flashlex, and the FlashLex API, as well as a bash script included in the distribution allow you to send messages from your thing to FlashLex to be stored for later retrieval. 

**Using the command line to Egress a message**

[source,bash]
----------------
echo '{"foo":"bar"}'|python -u collectmessage.py -c $(pwd)/../config.yml -k $(pwd)/../.

	}
}
FlashlexSDK Collector Status Code: 200
----------------

**Using the FlashLex SDK to Egress a message**

It is possible to egress a message from your thing using the FlashLex SDK. The python command line application `collectmessage.py` is also an example of how its done. You will need to have the FlashLex API installed in your appication directory's virtual environment to do that.

[source,python]
----------------
# now send a message to the collector
flashlexSDK = FlashlexSDK(config)
status_code = flashlexSDK.collectMessage({'foo':'bar'})
print("FlashlexSDK Collector Status Code:",status_code)
----------------

=== Using FlashLex to Collect Egressed Messages
There are two ways to collect messages that have been egressed fom your FlashLex thing. The first is to use the FlashLex web console. There is a form that will let you download all collected messages over a time period and within your retention policy.

image::thing-download-collected.png[Download collected messages,800,400]

A zip file will be downloaded to your `~/Downloads` directory. You can unzip it and inside you will see a single file for every message sent.

[source,bash]
----------------
