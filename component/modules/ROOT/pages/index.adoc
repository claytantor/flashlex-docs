== What is FlashLex?
FlashLex is an internet gateway for the internet of things. It provides a simple way to expose your IOT enabled device using our REST API in the cloud by installing distribution SDK bundles capabile of recieving and publishing IOT messages. The FlashLex platform routes published messages made via REST API calls using a secure access token to a topic subscribed by your thing, as well as provide a persistent queriable store for the collection of data published by your thing.   

It relies on two primary concepts for managing and communicating with each thing:

* Messaging - The ability to send a message to the thing via a topic, or pull messages that the thing has sent.
* Shadows - Controls the state of a specific thing. Use a JSON document to represent the aspects of the thing that should say the same until it is updated. These can be attribues such as gauges or system settings on the thing.

Core capabilities include:

* Sending Messages To Your Thing - Use the Cloud based REST API to send TLS based secure messages to your IOT device. Supports free text, json, or pinout based messages via REST API.
* Query and Collect Messages From Your Thing - Use the Cloud based REST API to query and collect data from your IOT device. Messages are stored in our database for searchable data collection based on message tagging. Messages expire if not collected.  
* Build IOT Applications using the Client SDK - 

FlashLex gives the IOT developer a simple messaging platform in the cloud so they can focus on building great things. This is accomplished by downloading the FlashLex Client SDK of their choice distribution and installing it on the thing. The IOT developer then can write their custom application code using the FlashLex Client SDK in the distribution. 

NOTE: Current language support for the SDK is limited to Python.
