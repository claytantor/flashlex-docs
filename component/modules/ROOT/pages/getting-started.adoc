This abridged guide assumes the following:

* You have registered. Go to the <<register.adoc#,register for flashlex>> docs for more info.

== How It Works
The Flashlex platform is an internet gateway for your thing. It simplifies accessing your IOT device by providing a simple HTTP REST API to dispatch messages.
